			<h4>Vector Self-Portrait</h4>
			<p>Our first major project in Graphic Design was to create a self-portrait using some of the techniques we learned in Adobe Illustrator, such as the Pen Tool, Eyedropper, and Paint Bucket Tool. This self-portrait designed by Emerald was submitted to the ACA World Championship and she won and competed in the competition in Dallas, TX.

			<h4>Infographic</h4>
			<p>This was an assignment for our Graphic Design II class. Working in a group of two we had to create an infographic for a topic of our choosing. This group decided on Apple's timeline of their products.
This was a great way to refresh our knowledge on Illustrator and help us get better. It was enjoyable to create icons and see the whole project come together.  We were able to see how well we worked in teams as well. This project was created and designed by Demitri Bannoura and Jasmine Phat.

			<h4>Sketchbook Project</h4>
			<p>This is a project that focused us on the usage of a sketchbook. Students had to develop a theme and do research in order to create a final piece. The theme Solange chose was touch,
Solange chose touch because of the different directions she could go with. She went with intimacy and lack of it, as represented with the colors. She used Sketchbook Pro for this painting; this project was created and designed by Solange Nhan.
